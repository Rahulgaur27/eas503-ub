Accessibility Services and Special Needs
-----------------------------------------
If you have any disability which requires reasonable accommodations to enable you to participate in this course, please contact the Office of Accessibility Resources in 60 Capen Hall, 716-645-2608 and also the instructor of this course during the first week of class. The office will provide you with information and review appropriate arrangements for reasonable accommodations, which can be found on the web at: http://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/accessibility.html.

Academic Integrity
-------------------
Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through the honest completion of academic work, students sustain the integrity of the university and of themselves while facilitating the university's imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based upon the generation of new and innovative ideas. For more information, please refer to the `Graduate Academic Integrity policy <https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity>`_.

This course will operate with a zero-tolerance policy regarding cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty. Any act of academic dishonesty will subject the student to penalty, including the high probability of failure of the course (i.e., assignment of a grade of “F”). It is expected that you will behave in an honorable and respectful way as you learn and share ideas. Therefore, recycled papers, work submitted to other courses, and major assistance in preparation of assignments without identifying and acknowledging such assistance are not acceptable. All work for this course must be original for this course. Additionally, you are not allowed to post course homeworks, exams, solutions, etc., on a public forum. Please be familiar with the University and the School policies regarding plagiarism.

.. admonition:: **Data Science Honor Code**

   By enrolling into this class, you are implicitly bound to the Data Science Honor Code. It is against the DS honor code to:

   1. Collaborate on homeworks and programming labs 
   2. Collaborate or cheat during exams
   3. Submit someone else’s work, including from the internet, as one’s own for any submission
   4. Misuse Piazza forum
